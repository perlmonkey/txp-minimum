Minimum theme for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com. See a "working demo here":http://minimum.yauh.de.

A huge *thank you* goes to "Amit Varia":http://amitvaria.com/, who inspired this theme.

Minimum enables you to publish your writings, but it does not allow you to:

* use comments
* use categories, sections, or even tags
* use article images (technically you can use images inside articles, just no article image)
* include a contact form
* hook up to social networks or have sharing buttons
* show off a massive link collection

Minimum is a theme that lets you write. What else would you need?

h2. Installation

Getting up and running is a breeze. Minimum is guaranteed to work on Textpattern 4.5.4. All you need is grab a copy of "cxc_templates":https://github.com/perlmonkey/txp-cxc-templates, install it and copy the minimum theme folder content to your @tpl@ directory.

h2. More Information

Have a look at "minimum.yauh.de":http://minimum.yauh.de for some more information about the theme.

*PS:* Since Minimum is so limited in what it does, changing most preference settings does not have much of an effect. It is, however, suggested that you have nice URLs (/article should be just fine) and disable the comments.
